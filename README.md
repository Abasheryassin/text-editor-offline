# Text Editor Offline

## Description

Taking notes with code snippets examples involved has proven to be tedious while learning how to code. While there are some great options online they still always require internet access. With this application, the goal was to be able to write code snippets and notes whenever i needed while saving them both locally and on the app as well. For this application i used IndexDB and Manifest to save the content and add logos to the app. 

## Installation

Navigate to the deployed Heroku app below and either start with writing code on the browser or install the application on your computer.
